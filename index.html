                    <p>When ownership changes in an organization, whether a partnership ends or a new owner, sometimes evolution is necessary. Iron North was looking to evolve their brand so it reflected the new ownership’s values more closely while retaining their community spirit. A star atop a mountain of type, coupled with medieval inspired house symbolism, Iron North’s new identity and assets reflect strength, community, and fun.</p>

            <p>A designer, musician, oddball and notorious over-thinker, I graduated from design school and began a journey with a partner to build a branding studio In Ottawa known as Salt. We did that, and we did it well, working with a multitude of startups, small businesses, non profits, events, and small to large organizations, like Algonquin College, helping them elevate their design and brand presence as best as we could. With every beginning comes an ending or perhaps a deviation from the path. This is where I find myself 
            today.</p>

            <p>Eager to see what’s on the other side of this newly opened door, I’m looking to continue my passion for graphic design and transform the noise in my mind into clear and empathetic brands and designs, whether it’s to join a team, help a startup, elevate a large organization, or anything in between.</p>
